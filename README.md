# FilmMeIn

### Description
This app utilizes theMovieDb API to display the details of trending and highly rated movies.
Additionally, movies can be favorited for ease of access later.

This project was built for the Udacity Android Developer nanodegree.


### What I accomplished in this project:

* Accessed theMovieDb to query for popular or highly rated movies, according to the users choice.
* Parsed the results to create Movie objects, which are displayed in a Grid using their posters.
* Utilized a Detail Activity to display further details when a poster is clicked.
* Allowed users to Favorite movies, which adds the movie to a local SQLite database for ease of access, online and offline.
* Retrieved results from that SQLite database, to show a Grid of the user's favorited movies.
